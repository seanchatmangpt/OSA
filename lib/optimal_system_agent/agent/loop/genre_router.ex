  Signal genre routing for the agent loop.

  Routes message handling based on the signal genre from upstream classification.
  Returns {:respond, text} to short-circuit with a direct response,
  or :execute_tools to continue normal LLM + tool execution.

  Genres from Signal Theory 5-tuple Type field:
    :direct   — user wants something done -> execute tools (default)
    :inform   — user is sharing info -> suggest memory_save, no tools
    :express  — emotional content -> empathetic response, no tools
    :decide   — user needs help deciding -> ask clarifying question first
    :commit   — user is committing to an action -> confirm plan before executing
