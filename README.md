## Why OSA Exists

We were building the AI layer for [MIOSA](https://miosa.ai) — an operating system for running your entire business. The agent needed to handle everything: scheduling meetings, analyzing revenue, drafting content, managing CRM contacts, orchestrating deployments. One AI, dozens of domains, thousands of messages a day.

We built Signal Theory to solve our own problem: most messages are noise, and processing noise at $0.015/1K tokens adds up fast. So we built a classifier that understands intent before spending compute. We built a noise filter that catches 40-60% of messages before they hit the LLM. We built a tier system that routes simple tasks to cheap models and complex ones to powerful models.

Then we saw [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw), [NanoClaw](https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw), and [Nanobot](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot) — and realized everyone else was still treating every message the same. Full pipeline, full cost, full latency, every time. No signal intelligence. No noise filtering. No cost optimization.

So we open-sourced OSA. The same agent that powers MIOSA, available to everyone. 47,000+ lines of Elixir/OTP + 16,000 lines of Rust TUI. 792 tests. Runs locally on your machine. Your data stays yours.

**If you're looking for an OpenClaw alternative that actually thinks before it acts — this is it.**

## The Problem

Every agent framework today treats every message the same. A "hey" goes through the same pipeline as "our production database is down." Every greeting, every "ok", every emoji reaction — full pipeline, full cost, full latency.

None of them solve the **intelligence problem.** They're message processors, not intelligent systems.

OSA is different. It's grounded in [Signal Theory](https://zenodo.org/records/18774174) — every message is classified, weighted, and routed before a single token of AI compute is spent. Noise gets filtered. Signals get prioritized. Complex tasks get decomposed across multiple agents. The system learns and adapts.

**63,000+ lines of Elixir/OTP + Rust. 792 tests. 147 resource files. Zero cloud dependency.**

## What Makes OSA Different

### 1. LLM-Primary Signal Classification

Every message is classified into a 5-tuple before processing — and the classifier is an LLM, not regex:

```
S = (Mode, Genre, Type, Format, Weight)

Mode:   What action    — BUILD, EXECUTE, ANALYZE, MAINTAIN, ASSIST
Genre:  Purpose        — DIRECT, INFORM, COMMIT, DECIDE, EXPRESS
Type:   Domain         — question, request, issue, scheduling, summary, report
Format: Container      — message, command, document, notification
Weight: Information    — 0.0 (noise) → 1.0 (critical signal)
```

The LLM understands intent. "Help me build a rocket" → BUILD mode (not ASSIST, which is what keyword matching would give you). "Can you run the tests?" → EXECUTE. The deterministic fallback only activates when the LLM is unavailable.

Results are cached in ETS (SHA256 key, 10-minute TTL) — repeated messages never hit the LLM twice.

### 2. Two-Tier Noise Filtering

```
Tier 1 (< 1ms):  Deterministic — regex patterns, length thresholds, duplicate detection
Tier 2 (~200ms): LLM-based — only for uncertain signals (weight 0.3-0.6)
```

40-60% of messages in a typical conversation are noise. OSA filters them before they reach your main AI model. Everyone else processes everything.

### 3. Autonomous Task Orchestration

Complex tasks get decomposed into parallel sub-agents automatically:

```
User: "Build me a REST API with auth, tests, and docs"

OSA Orchestrator:
  ├── Research agent — 12 tool uses — 45.2k tokens — analyzing codebase
  ├── Builder agent  — 28 tool uses — 89.1k tokens — writing implementation
  ├── Tester agent   — 8 tool uses  — 23.4k tokens — writing tests
  └── Writer agent   — 5 tool uses  — 12.8k tokens — writing documentation

Synthesis: 4 agents completed — files created, tests passing, docs written.
```

The orchestrator:
- Analyzes complexity via LLM (simple → single agent, complex → multi-agent)
- Decomposes into dependency-aware waves (topological sort)
- Spawns sub-agents with role-specific prompts (researcher, builder, tester, reviewer, writer)
- Tracks real-time progress (tool uses, tokens, current action) via event bus
- Synthesizes all results into a unified response

### 4. Intelligent Skill Discovery & Creation

Before creating a new skill, OSA searches existing ones:

```
User: "Create a skill for analyzing CSV data"

OSA: Found existing skills that may match:
  - file_read (relevance: 0.72) — Read file contents from the filesystem
  - shell_execute (relevance: 0.45) — Execute shell commands

  Use one of these, or should I create a new skill?

User: "Create a new one"
→ OSA writes ~/.osa/skills/csv-analyzer/SKILL.md and hot-registers it immediately.
```

Skills can be:
- **Built-in modules** — Elixir code implementing `Skills.Behaviour`
- **SKILL.md files** — Markdown-defined, drop in `~/.osa/skills/`, available instantly
- **MCP server tools** — Auto-discovered from `~/.osa/mcp.json`
- **Dynamically created** — The agent creates its own skills at runtime

### 5. Token-Budgeted Context Assembly

Context isn't dumped — it's assembled with a token budget:

```
CRITICAL (unlimited): System identity, active tools
HIGH     (40%):       Recent conversation turns, current task state
MEDIUM   (30%):       Relevant memories (keyword-searched, not full dump)
LOW      (remaining): Workflow context, environmental info
```

Smart token estimation: `words × 1.3 + punctuation × 0.5`. Relevance-scored memory retrieval: keyword overlap 50% + recency decay 30% + importance 20%.

### 6. Progressive Context Compression

Three-zone sliding window with importance-weighted retention:

```
HOT  (last 10 msgs):  Never touched — full fidelity
WARM (msgs 11-30):    Progressive compression — merge same-role, summarize groups
COLD (msgs 31+):      Key facts only — importance-weighted retention
```

5-step compression pipeline: strip tool args → merge same-role → summarize groups of 5 → compress cold → emergency truncate. Tool calls get +0.5 importance, acknowledgments get -0.5.

### 7. Three-Store Memory Architecture

```
Session Memory:  JSONL per session — full conversation history
Long-Term:       MEMORY.md — persistent knowledge base
Episodic Index:  ETS inverted index — keyword → session mapping
```

`recall_relevant/2` extracts keywords (150+ stop words filtered), searches the inverted index, scores by relevance, and returns the most relevant memories for injection into context.

### 8. Communication Intelligence

Five modules that understand how people communicate:

| Module | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|
| **Communication Profiler** | Learns each contact's style — response time, formality, topic preferences |
| **Communication Coach** | Scores outbound message quality before sending — clarity, tone, completeness |
| **Conversation Tracker** | Tracks depth from casual chat to deep strategic discussion (4 levels) |
| **Proactive Monitor** | Watches for silence, drift, and engagement drops — triggers alerts |
| **Contact Detector** | Identifies who's talking in under 1 millisecond |

No other agent framework has anything like this.

### 9. Multi-Agent Swarm Collaboration

```elixir
# Four collaboration patterns
:parallel     # All agents work simultaneously
:pipeline     # Agent output feeds into next agent
:debate       # Agents argue, consensus emerges
:review_loop  # Build → review → fix → re-review
```

Eight specialized agent roles with dedicated prompts. Mailbox-based inter-agent messaging. Dependency-aware wave execution.

### 10. PACT Framework (Planning → Action → Coordination → Testing)

Structured workflow execution with quality gates at every phase:

```
Phase 1: PLANNING    — Single planner agent decomposes intent into subtasks
Phase 2: ACTION      — Parallel workers execute subtasks via Task.async_stream
Phase 3: COORDINATE  — Synthesize results, resolve conflicts, merge outputs
Phase 4: TESTING     — Quality scoring, validation, rollback on gate failure
```

Each phase has a configurable quality gate. If a gate fails, the framework rolls back and re-plans. No garbage gets through.

### 11. Swarm Intelligence

Decentralized multi-agent coordination with 5 specialized roles:

| Role | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Explorer** | Broad research, surface-level analysis |
| **Specialist** | Deep-dive on specific domains |
| **Critic** | Challenge assumptions, find holes |
| **Synthesizer** | Merge findings into coherent output |
| **Coordinator** | Manage flow, break deadlocks |

Shared memory via an Agent process. Hypothesis voting system (-1 to +1). Convergence threshold (0.8) determines when the swarm has reached consensus.

### 12. Universal Tier System (18 Providers × 3 Tiers)

Every provider maps to three compute tiers — elite, specialist, utility:

```
anthropic:  claude-opus-4-6      → claude-sonnet-4-6     → claude-haiku-4-5
openai:     gpt-4o               → gpt-4o-mini           → gpt-3.5-turbo
google:     gemini-2.5-pro       → gemini-2.0-flash      → gemini-2.0-flash-lite
groq:       llama-3.3-70b        → llama-3.1-70b         → llama-3.1-8b-instant
ollama:     [auto-detected by model size — largest→elite, smallest→utility]
...and 13 more providers
```

Ollama tiers are detected dynamically at boot — queries `/api/tags`, sorts installed models by file size, assigns to tiers, caches in `:persistent_term`. No manual config needed.

### 13. Hook Middleware Pipeline

16 hooks fire at lifecycle events (pre_tool_use, post_tool_use, pre_response, session_end):

```
security_check (p10)        — Block dangerous tool calls
context_optimizer (p12)     — Track tool load, warn on heavy usage
mcp_cache (p15)             — Cache MCP schemas in persistent_term
validate_prompt (p20)       — Keyword→context hints for better prompts
budget_tracker (p25)        — Token budget enforcement
quality_check (p30)         — Output quality scoring
episodic_memory (p60)       — Write JSONL episodes to ~/.osa/learning/
metrics_dashboard (p80)     — JSONL metrics + periodic summary
hierarchical_compaction (p95) — 4-tier context utilization alerts
...and 7 more
```

Priority-ordered execution. Each hook returns `{:ok, payload}`, `{:block, reason}`, or `:skip`. Blocked = pipeline stops.

### 14. Agent Ecosystem (25 Definitions)

Pre-built agent definitions across 4 categories:

```
priv/agents/
├── elite/       — dragon (10K+ RPS), oracle (AI/ML), nova (AI-arch), blitz (<100μs), architect
├── combat/      — parallel, cache, quantum, angel (K8s)
├── security/    — security-auditor, red-team, blue-team, purple-team, threat-intel
└── specialists/ — backend-go, frontend-react, frontend-svelte, database, debugger,
                   test-automator, code-reviewer, explorer, agent-creator, technical-writer,
                   dependency-analyzer
```

Each definition is a markdown file with role prompt, capabilities, and constraints. Loaded at runtime via `Roster.load_definition/1`.

### 15. 63 Slash Commands + 29 Skill Definitions

```
/commit    /build     /test      /lint      /verify     /create-pr
/fix       /explain   /debug     /review    /refactor   /agents
/status    /doctor    /analytics /security-scan          /secret-scan
/prime-backend        /prime-webdev         /prime-svelte
/mem-search           /mem-save             /mem-recall
...and 40+ more
```

Commands are markdown templates in `priv/commands/` — expanded as prompts at invocation. 29 skill definitions in `priv/skills/` with YAML frontmatter for triggers, priority, and metadata.

### 16. Docker Container Isolation (Optional)

```bash
mix osa.sandbox.setup   # Build the sandbox image
```

- Read-only root filesystem
- `CAP_DROP ALL` — zero Linux capabilities
- Network isolation
- Warm container pool for instant execution
- Ubuntu 24.04 base with common dev tools

## 18 LLM Providers

| **Baichuan** | Cloud | Baichuan4 | Baichuan3-Turbo | Baichuan3-Turbo-128k |

Shared `OpenAICompat` base for 14 providers. Native implementations for Anthropic and Ollama. Fallback chain: if primary fails, next provider picks up automatically. Every provider has 3-tier model mapping — the system automatically routes to the right model for the task complexity.

```bash
export OSA_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=groq
export GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...
# Done. OSA now uses Groq for all inference.
```

## Install

**30 seconds. No Erlang. No Elixir. No compilation.**

### Homebrew (macOS / Linux)

```bash
brew tap miosa-osa/tap
brew install osagent
osagent
```

### One-liner (macOS / Linux)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Miosa-osa/OSA/main/install.sh | sh
osagent
```

The installer:
- Detects OS (macOS/Linux) and architecture (arm64/amd64)
- Auto-installs Rust and Elixir if missing (with prompt)
- Builds the Rust TUI and Elixir backend
- Installs `osa` and `osagent` to `~/.local/bin/`
- Creates `~/.osa/` config directory with `.env` template
- Adds `~/.local/bin` to your PATH

**After install, `osa` works from any directory on your machine.** No need to `cd` into the project. The launcher resolves the project root via `~/.osa/project_root` automatically.

### From Source

For contributors or if you want to hack on OSA itself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Miosa-osa/OSA.git
cd OSA
mix setup              # deps + database + compile
bin/osa                # start talking
```

`bin/osa` builds the Rust TUI on first run, starts the Elixir backend in the background, waits for health, and launches the terminal UI. One command, one terminal. When you quit, the backend shuts down automatically.

Requires Elixir 1.17+ and Erlang/OTP 27+, Rust/Cargo (for TUI build). See [Getting Started](docs/getting-started/) for full setup guide.

---

## Quick Start

### Which command do I use?

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `osa` | **Recommended.** Backend + Rust TUI in one command. Works from any directory. |
| `osa --dev` | Dev mode (profile isolation, port 19001) |
| `osa setup` | Run the setup wizard (provider, API keys) |
| `mix osa.chat` | Backend + built-in Elixir CLI (no TUI) |
| `mix osa.serve` | Backend only (for custom clients) |
| `osagent` | TUI binary only (connects to running backend) |

**First time?** Just run `osa`. It auto-detects first run and launches the setup wizard.

The Rust TUI gives you tree connectors on tool calls, per-agent sub-status, task checklists, thinking time display, expand/collapse with `ctrl+o`, and background tasks with `ctrl+b`.

## Usage

```bash
# Run from anywhere on your machine
osa                    # interactive chat (backend + TUI)
osa setup              # configure provider + API keys
osa --dev              # dev mode (port 19001)

# Development (from project directory)
mix osa.chat           # backend + built-in Elixir CLI
mix osa.serve          # backend only (headless HTTP API on port 8089)
mix osa.setup          # setup wizard only
```

On first run, `osa` launches a setup wizard — pick your LLM provider, paste an API key (or choose Ollama for fully local), and you're chatting.

### Switch Providers

```bash
# Local AI (default — free, private, no API key)
osa setup              # select Ollama

# Cloud — pick any of 18 providers
osa setup              # select Anthropic, OpenAI, Groq, DeepSeek, etc.

# Or set env vars directly (in ~/.osa/.env)
OSA_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

Config lives in `~/.osa/.env` and `~/.osa/config.json`.

### Upgrade

```bash
# Homebrew
brew upgrade osagent

# Install script — just re-run it
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Miosa-osa/OSA/main/install.sh | sh
```

### Chat Channels

```bash
# Enable Telegram
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...

# Enable Discord
export DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=...

# Enable Slack
export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=...
export SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=...

# Channels auto-start when their config is present
```

## HTTP API

OSA exposes a REST API on port 8089 for SDK clients and integrations:

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8089/health

# Classify a message (Signal Theory 5-tuple)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8089/api/v1/classify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

  -d '{"task": "Review this codebase for security issues", "pattern": "review_loop"}'

# List available skills
curl http://localhost:8089/api/v1/skills

# Create a dynamic skill
curl -X POST http://localhost:8089/api/v1/skills/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "csv-analyzer", "description": "Analyze CSV files", "instructions": "..."}'

# Stream events (SSE)
curl http://localhost:8089/api/v1/stream/my-session

### OTP Supervision Tree

Every component is supervised. If any part crashes, OTP restarts just that component — no downtime, no data loss, no manual intervention. This is the same technology that powers telecom switches with 99.9999% uptime.

## Workflow Examples

OSA ships with workflow templates for common complex tasks:

```bash
# Example workflows in examples/workflows/
build-rest-api.json         # 5-step API scaffolding
build-fullstack-app.json    # 8-step full-stack build
debug-production-issue.json # 7-step systematic debugging
content-campaign.json       # 6-step content creation
code-review.json            # 4-step code review
```

The workflow engine tracks progress, accumulates context between steps, supports checkpointing/resume, and auto-detects when a task should become a workflow.

## Adding Custom Skills

### Option 1: SKILL.md (No Code)

Drop a markdown file in `~/.osa/skills/your-skill/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: data-analyzer
description: Analyze datasets and produce insights
tools:
  - file_read
  - shell_execute
---

## Instructions

When asked to analyze data:
1. Read the file to understand its structure
2. Use shell commands to run analysis (pandas, awk, etc.)
3. Produce a summary with key findings
```

Available immediately — no restart, no rebuild.

### Option 2: Elixir Module (Full Power)

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Skills.Calculator do
  @behaviour OptimalSystemAgent.Skills.Behaviour

  @impl true
  def name, do: "calculator"

  @impl true
  def description, do: "Evaluate a math expression"

  @impl true
  def parameters do
    %{"type" => "object",
      "properties" => %{
        "expression" => %{"type" => "string"}
      }, "required" => ["expression"]}
  end

  @impl true
  def execute(%{"expression" => expr}) do
    {result, _} = Code.eval_string(expr)
    {:ok, "#{result}"}
  end
end

# Register at runtime — available immediately:
OptimalSystemAgent.Skills.Registry.register(MyApp.Skills.Calculator)
```

### Option 3: Let OSA Create Skills Dynamically

OSA can create its own skills at runtime when it encounters a task that needs a capability that doesn't exist yet. It writes a SKILL.md file and hot-registers it — the skill is available for all future sessions.

## MCP Integration

Full Model Context Protocol support:

```json
// ~/.osa/mcp.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/home/user"]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
    }
  }
}
```

MCP tools are auto-discovered and available alongside built-in skills.

## OS Template Integration

OSA auto-discovers and integrates with OS templates:

```bash
> connect to ~/Desktop/MIOSA/BusinessOS

# OSA scans the directory, detects the stack (Go + Svelte + PostgreSQL),
# finds modules (CRM, Projects, Invoicing), and saves the connection.
```

Ship a `.osa-manifest.json` for full integration:

```json
{
  "osa_manifest": 1,
  "name": "BusinessOS",
  "stack": { "backend": "go", "frontend": "svelte", "database": "postgresql" },
  "modules": [
    { "id": "crm", "name": "CRM", "paths": ["backend/internal/modules/crm/"] }
  ],
  "skills": [
    { "name": "create_contact", "endpoint": "POST /api/v1/contacts" }
  ]
}
```

## Theoretical Foundation

OSA is grounded in four principles from communication and systems theory:

1. **Shannon (Channel Capacity):** Every channel has finite capacity. Processing noise wastes capacity meant for real signals.
2. **Ashby (Requisite Variety):** The system must match the variety of its inputs — 18 providers, 12 channels, unlimited skills.
3. **Beer (Viable System Model):** Five operational modes (Build, Assist, Analyze, Execute, Maintain) mirror the five subsystems every viable organization needs.
4. **Wiener (Feedback Loops):** Every action produces feedback. The agent learns and adapts — memory, cortex, profiling.
