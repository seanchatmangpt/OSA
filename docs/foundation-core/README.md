## What You Are Looking At

OSA is a production AI agent system built on Elixir/OTP. It is the intelligence
layer of the [MIOSA](https://miosa.ai) platform and is also fully usable as a
standalone local agent.

The architecture solves a real problem: every existing agent framework processes
every message through the same pipeline regardless of complexity. OSA classifies
each input into a 5-tuple signal before routing — matching compute to complexity
automatically, at sub-millisecond speed, before the LLM is ever invoked.

This section documents the **foundation**: why OSA exists, the principles that
govern its design, where its boundaries lie, the dependency rules its modules
obey, and the vocabulary used throughout all other documentation.

## System Summary

### Signal Theory Classification

Every input is classified into a 5-tuple before routing:

```
S = (Mode, Genre, Type, Format, Weight)
```

| Dimension | Values |
|---|---|
| Mode | BUILD, EXECUTE, ANALYZE, MAINTAIN, ASSIST |
| Genre | DIRECT, INFORM, COMMIT, DECIDE, EXPRESS |
| Type | question, request, issue, scheduling, summary, report, general |
| Format | message, command, document, notification |
| Weight | 0.0 (trivial) to 1.0 (critical, multi-step) |

Weight drives tier selection:

| Weight Range | Tier | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| 0.00 – 0.35 | Utility | Haiku, GPT-3.5-turbo, 8B local models |
| 0.35 – 0.65 | Specialist | Sonnet, GPT-4o-mini, 70B local models |
| 0.65 – 1.00 | Elite | Opus, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro |

### OTP Supervision Tree (top-level)

```
OptimalSystemAgent.Supervisor  (rest_for_one)
├── Platform.Repo              PostgreSQL — multi-tenant (conditional)
├── Supervisors.Infrastructure  (rest_for_one) — core registries, event bus, storage
├── Supervisors.Sessions        (one_for_one)  — channel adapters, agent loop processes
├── Supervisors.AgentServices   (one_for_one)  — memory, hooks, orchestrator, vault
├── Supervisors.Extensions      (one_for_one)  — sandbox, fleet, sidecars (opt-in)
├── Channels.Starter            Deferred channel boot
└── Bandit HTTP                 REST API — port 8089
```

### Key Numbers

| Metric | Count |
|---|---|
| Elixir modules | 287+ |
| LLM providers | 18 (3 tiers each) |
| Chat channels | 12 |
| Built-in tools | 34 |
| Slash commands | 91+ |
| Agent roles in roster | 31 named + 17 specialized |
| Tests | ~2,000 |
| Vault memory categories | 8 |
| Hook lifecycle events | 7 |
| Swarm collaboration patterns | 4 |

## Runtime Ports

| Port | Service |
|---|---|
| 8089 | Elixir backend — REST API + SSE + webhook receiver |
| 9089 | Tauri desktop app sidecar (connects to 8089 on startup) |
| 11434 | Ollama local inference (default, optional) |

## Quick Navigation

**New to OSA?** Start with [Purpose](overview/purpose.md) then
[System Boundaries](overview/system-boundaries.md).

**Building on OSA?** Read [Dependency Rules](overview/dependency-rules.md) and
the [Glossary](overview/glossary.md), then move to the
[backend docs](../backend/).

**Deploying OSA?** See [operations docs](../operations/).

**Contributing?** The [architecture docs](../architecture/) cover the
full supervision tree, data flow, Signal Theory spec, and ADRs.
