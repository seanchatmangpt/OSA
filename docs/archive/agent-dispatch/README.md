# Agent Dispatch

> Multi-agent development sprint framework for AI coding agents.
> Drop into any codebase. Coordinate parallel AI agents. Ship faster.

## What This Is

Agent Dispatch coordinates multiple AI coding agents working simultaneously on a single codebase. You describe what needs to happen. An AI planner reads your codebase, maps the architecture, discovers work, writes execution traces, and proposes a sprint. You approve. It generates everything — the dispatch plan, per-agent task docs with exact implementation specs, and activation prompts ready to paste into agent terminals. Each agent works on its own git branch with defined file-level territory. When they finish, branches merge in dependency order with build + test validation after every merge.

**It is:** A methodology, a planning system, and a template library. Markdown docs you drop into any repo.

**It is not:** Software. No runtime, no daemon, no CLI, no SDK. The agents are whatever AI coding tools you already use — Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Aider, Windsurf, or anything else that can read files and run commands.

---

## How It Works

```
PLAN → DISPATCH → EXECUTE → MONITOR → MERGE → SHIP

1. PLAN
   You: "Fix the auth bugs, add rate limiting, close the security findings"
   AI reads: sprint-planner.md + your codebase
   AI produces: sprint proposal (agents, waves, chains, success criteria)
   You: approve / adjust

2. DISPATCH
   AI generates: DISPATCH.md + per-agent task docs + activation prompts
   You run: git worktree setup (one isolated branch per agent)
   You paste: activation prompts into agent terminals

3. EXECUTE (agents work in parallel, in waves)
   Wave 1: DATA, QA, INFRA, DESIGN       → foundation, no dependencies
   Wave 2: BACKEND, SERVICES              → need stable data layer
   Wave 3: FRONTEND                       → needs design specs + backend API
   Wave 4: RED TEAM                       → adversarial review of all branches
   Wave 5: LEAD                           → merge + ship

4. MONITOR
   Track agent status, chain progress, sprint health
   React to events (CI fails, stuck agents, territory violations)
   Intervene with correction messages when needed

5. MERGE
   RED TEAM reviews all branches for security/edge cases (can BLOCK merge)
   LEAD merges branches in dependency order: DATA → DESIGN → BACKEND → ...
   Build + test after EVERY merge. No exceptions.

6. SHIP
   Tag release. Delete worktrees. Done.
```

## The Core Idea: Execution Traces

This is what separates Agent Dispatch from "just ask an AI to fix things."

Agents don't work on "directories." They work on **execution traces** — a traced path through the codebase from entry point to root cause, with the exact fix site and verification steps.

```
Weak prompt:
  "BACKEND: fix bugs in handlers/"
  → Agent scans randomly, makes scattered changes, misses root causes

Execution trace:
  "Chain 1 [P1]: POST /webhooks/stripe → webhookHandler.ProcessEvent()
   → paymentService.HandleInvoicePaid() → subscriptionStore.Activate()
   Signal: 504 timeout. Mutex held during network I/O under lock.
   Fix: subscriptionStore.Activate() — release lock before notification call.
   Verify: Test webhook returns < 2s. No race condition on concurrent activations."
  → Agent follows the signal, finds the exact failure point, fixes surgically
```

Every agent gets chains like this. They complete one fully (trace → fix → verify → document) before starting the next. Priority order: P0 (stop everything) → P1 (critical) → P2 (important) → P3 (if time permits).

See [core/methodology.md](core/methodology.md) for the full theory.

## Quick Start

### 1. Drop into your project

```bash
cp -r agent-dispatch/ your-project/docs/agent-dispatch/
```

### 2. Plan your first sprint

Give your AI this prompt:

```
Read docs/agent-dispatch/guides/sprint-planner.md — follow it step by step.
Then read the codebase. Analyze the architecture, discover work, write execution
traces, and propose a sprint plan.

Sprint goal: [what you want to accomplish]
```

The AI reads the Sprint Planner guide, analyzes your codebase, maps territories, discovers bugs/debt/security gaps, writes execution traces, and proposes a sprint with agents, waves, and success criteria. You review and approve.

### 3. Dispatch

After approval, the AI generates:
- `sprint-XX/DISPATCH.md` — the full sprint plan
- `sprint-XX/agent-X-*.md` — per-agent task docs with exact implementation specs
- Activation prompts — ready to paste into agent terminals

Set up worktrees, paste prompts, agents start working.

### 4. Run

Follow the [Operator's Guide](guides/operators-guide.md) for the full tutorial, or the [Quick Start](guides/quickstart.md) for the fastest path.

## The 9 Agents

| Code | Name | Domain | Wave |
|------|------|--------|------|
| F | **DATA** | Models, stores, migrations, queries | 1 |
| E | **QA** | Tests, security audits, coverage | 1 |
| C | **INFRA** | Docker, CI/CD, builds, deployment | 1 |
| H | **DESIGN** | Design tokens, component specs, accessibility | 1 |
| A | **BACKEND** | Handlers, routes, services, middleware | 2 |
| D | **SERVICES** | Workers, integrations, external API clients | 2 |
| B | **FRONTEND** | Components, routes, stores, hooks | 3 |
| R | **RED TEAM** | Adversarial review — break other agents' work before merge | 4 |
| G | **LEAD** | Merge, docs, ship decision | 5 |

Scale to the work. A 3-chain bug fix needs 2 agents, not 9. A full-stack migration might need all of them. For 20-30+ agents, roles split into nested teams — see [scaling/scaling.md](scaling/scaling.md).

Each agent has its own file in [`agents/`](agents/) with territory definitions, responsibilities, wave placement, and merge order.

---

## What Gets Generated

When the AI plans a sprint, it produces three types of documents:

### DISPATCH.md — The Sprint Plan
Sprint goals, execution traces for every chain, wave assignments, agent territories, merge order, success criteria, worktree setup script. Template: [templates/dispatch.md](templates/dispatch.md)

### Agent Task Docs — Per-Agent Implementation Specs
One per agent. Contains: numbered context reading list, files owned, tasks with IDs (current state → required changes with code examples), wave organization, territory rules with agent attribution, verification checklist with exact commands and expected output, commit strategy. Template: [templates/agent.md](templates/agent.md)

### Activation Prompts — Copy-Paste Into Terminals
One per agent. Contains: identity, context files to read, domain + cross-agent awareness, task summary by wave, chains with execution traces, territory, execution protocol (BEFORE/WHILE/AFTER coding methodology), completion instructions. Template: [templates/activation.md](templates/activation.md)

Agents produce **completion reports** when done — what changed, what was blocked, P0 discoveries, files modified, verification results. Template: [templates/completion.md](templates/completion.md)

## How Agent Dispatch Differs

**"How is this different from CrewAI / AutoGen / LangGraph?"**

Those are **runtime frameworks** — they run code, manage agent sessions, automate workflows. Agent Dispatch is a **planning methodology** — it defines what agents should work on, in what order, with what boundaries.

| Aspect | Agent Dispatch | Runtime Frameworks |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| **What it is** | Methodology + templates (markdown) | Software (TypeScript/Python) |
| **Execution traces** | Core concept | Not addressed |
| **Chain execution** | One trace-fix-verify at a time | Task queues |
| **Territory isolation** | File-level ownership per agent | Not addressed |
| **Wave dependencies** | Dependency-aware dispatch order | Basic task deps |
| **Adversarial review** | RED TEAM reviews all branches | Not addressed |
| **AI-assisted planning** | Sprint Planner reads codebase, proposes plan | Manual task definition |
| **Merge strategy** | Dependency-ordered with validation | Not addressed |
| **Scaling** | Nested teams, 30+ agents | Session scaling |
| **Install** | Copy markdown into repo | `npm install` / `pip install` |

**They're complementary.** Use Agent Dispatch to plan the sprint. Use a runtime framework to automate the dispatch loop. The planning layer makes the automation layer effective.

---

## Stack Compatibility

Stack-agnostic. Works with anything that uses git:

| Stack | Application Type |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Go** (Chi, Gin, Echo, Fiber) | API servers, microservices, CLI tools |
| **TypeScript / Node.js** (Next.js, SvelteKit, Express, NestJS) | Full-stack web apps, APIs, serverless |
| **Python** (Django, FastAPI, Flask) | Web apps, ML pipelines, data services |
| **Rust** (Actix, Axum, Rocket) | Systems programming, high-performance APIs |
| **Elixir / Erlang** (Phoenix, LiveView) | Real-time apps, distributed systems |
| **Java / Kotlin** (Spring Boot, Ktor) | Enterprise APIs, event-driven systems |
| **C / C++** (FreeRTOS, STM32, CMake) | Embedded firmware, IoT, systems |
| **PHP** (Laravel, Symfony, legacy) | Web apps, monoliths, CMS |
| **Ruby** (Rails, Hanami) | Web applications |
| **C# / .NET** (ASP.NET Core, Blazor) | Enterprise web apps, microservices |

Monoliths, microservices, monorepos, full-stack apps, backend-only APIs, frontend SPAs, ML pipelines, embedded firmware, legacy codebases, infrastructure-as-code.

For legacy codebases with no tests, no docs, and spaghetti code, see [guides/legacy-codebases.md](guides/legacy-codebases.md).
